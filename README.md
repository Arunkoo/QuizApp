# React Redux Quiz App

Welcome to the React Redux Quiz App! This project is built using React, Redux, Tailwind CSS, and Vite. It's a quiz application that handles errors gracefully when there's no data to render. The application has various components and features described below:

## Features

- **Ready State**: Upon loading, the UI displays a welcome component along with a button to start the quiz.
- **Quiz Interface**: Once the quiz starts, a question is displayed along with a progress bar, points tracker, and timer.
- **Scoring**: Points are awarded based on the correctness and timeliness of the answers provided by the user.
- **Finish Component**: When the time runs out, the finish component is rendered, displaying the user's score, percentage, and position.
- **Highscore Functionality**: The application keeps track of the user's high score, replacing it with the initial score whenever a new high score is achieved.
- **Play Again Option**: After completing the quiz, users have the option to play again.
